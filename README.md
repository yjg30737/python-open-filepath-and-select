# python-open-filepath-and-select
Show the file path on explorer and select it with Python

I made this despite how short it is because i used this code a lot of times.

## Setup
```pip3 install git+https://github.com/yjg30737/python-open-filepath-and-select.git --upgrade```


## Example
```python
from python_open_filepath_and_select.openFilePathAndSelect import open_file_path_and_select

open_file_path_and_select('lorem.txt')
```

Result
